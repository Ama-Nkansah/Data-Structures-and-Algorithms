# Algorithm vs Program

## Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step approach or method to solve a problem. It's the *plan* or *logic* behind solving a task, independent of the actual implementation. The algorithm focuses on the *what* needs to be done and how to approach it. 

**Important**: An algorithm doesn't depend on specific hardware or programming languages. It’s more of a conceptual plan that can be implemented in any language or run on any machine.

**Example**:  
In web development, creating a wireframe, selecting colors, deciding on breakpoints, and choosing layout structures are all part of the **algorithm**. It’s your design and logic for how the website should function.

## Program

A **program** is the procedure or method used to implement an algorithm using a specific programming language. It's the actual *code* or *instructions* you write to make the algorithm work in a computer. 

**Important**: A program depends on specific programming languages and hardware to run. The program is the practical implementation of the algorithm in code.

**Example**:  
Writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to turn your wireframe and design choices into a live website is the **program**. It's the *how* you bring your algorithm (design plan) to life.

## Priori Analysis (Before Execution)

- Priori analysis is when you evaluate the algorithm *before* implementation.
- It’s a prediction of how effective the algorithm will be based on its structure, logic, and steps.

**Example**:  
Analyzing how many steps a sorting algorithm will take or estimating the time complexity of an algorithm before writing the program.

## Posteriori Testing (After Execution)

- Posteriori testing is when you test the **program** after you’ve implemented it.
- It’s about evaluating the program’s actual performance in practice: how fast it runs, how much memory it uses, and if it solves the problem correctly.

**Example**:  
Running the code for a sorting algorithm and checking if it correctly sorts the list and how fast it executes.

## Summary

- **Algorithm**: The *step-by-step plan* to solve a problem. It doesn't depend on specific hardware or programming languages.
- **Program**: The *execution* of that plan using code in a programming language. It depends on the hardware and language used.
- **Priori Analysis**: Predicting the effectiveness of an algorithm before implementing it.
- **Posteriori Testing**: Testing the program after it’s been implemented.
